# Backlog

## Purpose

Single priority-ordered list of post-MVP follow-up work across all concern
areas. Each entry links to the detail file that explains the full context,
steps, and validation commands.

**How to use this file:**

- Start here to find the highest-priority next item.
- Read the linked detail file before starting any item.
- Keep this file focused on active work.
- When an item is complete, update the owning detail file and remove the item
  from this backlog instead of leaving closed history inline.
- Add new items in the correct tier with a one-line why and a detail link.
- `decision` items require a product or design choice before dev work can
  start. `dev`, `ux`, and `infra` items are ready to execute.

## Tier 1 — Live Event Readiness

Must be resolved before QR codes are printed or the first real event runs.

---

## Tier 2 — Operational Confidence

Reduce deployment risk and contributor friction before the live event.

- [ ] **`infra` Surface CI step logs in PR comments on failure**
  AI coding agents working inside a session can't authenticate to the Actions
  logs API, so a failing PR CI run leaves the agent without the real
  diagnostic. Add an `if: failure()` step to the CI workflow that tails the
  first failing step and posts it as a PR comment, so PR activity webhooks
  relay the log back into the session automatically.
  Detail: [`docs/tracking/dev-workflow-improvements.md` — Surface CI step logs in PR comments on failure](/docs/tracking/dev-workflow-improvements.md)

- [ ] **`dev` Assert allowlist-filtered zero-row access on `game_event_admin_status`**
  Slice 2 added view grant checks, but its pgTAP file still relies on underlying
  `game_event_drafts` RLS coverage for the “authenticated but not allowlisted
  sees zero rows” case. Add a direct view-level assertion so future view or
  policy changes cannot widen access silently.
  Detail: [`docs/plans/archive/admin-live-status-plan.md`](/docs/plans/archive/admin-live-status-plan.md)

---

## Tier 3 — Admin Authoring Polish

Improve the authoring experience before the organizer uses it to set up a real
event.

- [ ] **`docs` Rewrite `database-backed-quiz-content.md` and `quiz-authoring-plan.md` to target terminology**
  These two plan docs still use legacy `quiz`/`raffle` language (12 and 27
  occurrences respectively). All other docs were swept in Phases 1 and 5; these
  were deferred due to size. Rewrite narrative and headings to use
  `game`/`entitlement` names per the migration policy.
  Detail: [`docs/plans/archive/terminology-migration-map.md` — Documentation](/docs/plans/archive/terminology-migration-map.md)

- [x] **`ux` Mobile question editor layout**
  Rework the question editor stacking on narrow viewports so the question list,
  focused editor, and option controls do not crowd each other. The highest-value
  admin UX refinement before real authoring use.
  Detail: [`docs/tracking/admin-ux-roadmap.md` — Improve the mobile question editor layout](/docs/tracking/admin-ux-roadmap.md)

- [ ] **`ux` Desktop admin workspace hierarchy**
  Clarify the two-panel balance between the event summary, event-details form,
  and question editor on wide screens. Affects editing confidence before preview
  and publish controls add more surface to the same page.
  Detail: [`docs/tracking/admin-ux-roadmap.md` — Clarify the desktop admin workspace hierarchy](/docs/tracking/admin-ux-roadmap.md)

## Tier 4 — Post-MVP Features

Planned capabilities intentionally deferred from the MVP scope. Require product
prioritization before starting.

- [ ] **`ux` Manual attendee redemption-status refresh**
  Add a `Refresh status` affordance on the completion screen so an attendee can
  trigger a re-read without waiting for the next polling tick.
  Detail: [`docs/plans/archive/reward-redemption-phase-c-1-plan.md`](/docs/plans/archive/reward-redemption-phase-c-1-plan.md)

- [ ] **`ux` Timestamped attendee redeemed-state copy**
  Add redeemed-at time copy on the attendee completion screen, including the
  locale/timezone handling needed to make that timestamp trustworthy.
  Detail: [`docs/plans/archive/reward-redemption-phase-c-1-plan.md`](/docs/plans/archive/reward-redemption-phase-c-1-plan.md)

- [ ] **`ux` Attendee completion freshness and transient-error state**
  Surface lightweight freshness/error guidance on the completion screen so a
  long backend outage does not leave attendees staring at stale status with no
  explanation.
  Detail: [`docs/plans/archive/reward-redemption-phase-c-1-plan.md`](/docs/plans/archive/reward-redemption-phase-c-1-plan.md)

- [ ] **`ux` Reversal-aware attendee completion copy**
  Distinguish a row that flipped from redeemed back to unredeemed mid-session
  instead of falling back to the generic ready-for-check-in wording.
  Detail: [`docs/plans/archive/reward-redemption-phase-c-1-plan.md`](/docs/plans/archive/reward-redemption-phase-c-1-plan.md)

- [ ] **`dev` Admin draft preview** (Phase 4.5)
  Let an admin preview the attendee experience from the draft before publishing.
  Detail: [`docs/plans/archive/quiz-authoring-plan.md` — Phase 4.5](/docs/plans/archive/quiz-authoring-plan.md)

- [ ] **`dev` AI-assisted authoring** (Phase 4.7)
  AI-generated draft questions refined by the organizer.
  Detail: [`docs/plans/archive/quiz-authoring-plan.md` — Phase 4.7](/docs/plans/archive/quiz-authoring-plan.md)

- [ ] **`dev` Analytics and reporting**
  SQL views on `game_completions`, `game_entitlements`, and `game_starts`
  to produce per-event completion counts, score distributions, timing summaries,
  and sponsor question engagement. Follow-on: an organizer-facing reporting
  section in the admin workspace that surfaces those views for a selected event
  without requiring Supabase Studio access.
  Detail: [`docs/plans/analytics-strategy.md`](/docs/plans/analytics-strategy.md)

- [ ] **`ux` Organizer-managed agent assignment**
  Now that organizers have full event-scoped write access via M2's RLS
  broadening, add a way for an organizer to maintain event agents without
  requiring manual root-admin SQL edits. Unblocked by M2 phases 2.1 + 2.1.1
  + 2.1.2 (organizer authorization across PostgREST + Edge Functions).
  Detail: [`docs/plans/event-platform-epic.md` — Open Questions Resolved By This Epic](/docs/plans/event-platform-epic.md)

- [ ] **`dev` Richer publish controls**
  Expiry windows, scheduled publish, multiple games per event, and friendlier
  inactive-event behavior beyond immediate unpublish.
  Detail: [`docs/open-questions.md` — Authoring And Publishing](/docs/open-questions.md)

- [ ] **`ux` Event landing page for `/event/:slug`**
  Gameplay now lives on `/event/:slug/game`. Add an event landing surface at
  `/event/:slug` once the product starts supporting multiple experiences per
  event so navigation and URL contracts scale cleanly.
  Detail: [`docs/open-questions.md` — Product And Live Event Operation](/docs/open-questions.md)

- [ ] **`decision` Sponsor reporting requirements**
  Determine the minimum reporting slice sponsors actually need: simple inclusion
  proof, aggregate event totals, or question-level reporting.
  Detail: [`docs/open-questions.md` — Reporting And Sponsor Measurement](/docs/open-questions.md)

## Tier 5 — Code Health And Tooling

Internal maintainability and contributor workflow. No user-facing impact.
Execute in any order.

- [ ] **`dev` Split `gameApi.ts` local fallback** (refactor score 8/10)
  Extract local prototype entitlement storage and completion into a separate
  module so the production Supabase path is easier to review.
  Detail: [`docs/tracking/code-refactor-checklist.md`](/docs/tracking/code-refactor-checklist.md)

- [ ] **`dev` Split `AdminQuestionEditor.tsx`** (refactor score 7/10)
  Extract `AdminQuestionList` and `AdminOptionEditor` so the top-level editor
  reads as buffer/save orchestration.
  Detail: [`docs/tracking/code-refactor-checklist.md`](/docs/tracking/code-refactor-checklist.md)

- [ ] **`dev` Split `capture-ui-review.cjs` admin mode** (refactor score 7/10)
  Extract admin-specific Supabase mocks and admin screenshot sequences into
  focused helper modules so the shared runner stays readable.
  Detail: [`docs/tracking/code-refactor-checklist.md`](/docs/tracking/code-refactor-checklist.md)

- [ ] **`dev` Split `AdminEventWorkspace.tsx`** (refactor score 6/10)
  Extract summary card, selected draft header, and action groups so the
  route-level component mainly coordinates layout and callbacks.
  Detail: [`docs/tracking/code-refactor-checklist.md`](/docs/tracking/code-refactor-checklist.md)

- [ ] **`dev` Split `adminGameApi.ts`** (refactor score 5/10)
  Extract shared transport and response helpers so the public exports focus on
  intent-specific admin operations.
  Detail: [`docs/tracking/code-refactor-checklist.md`](/docs/tracking/code-refactor-checklist.md)

- [ ] **`dev` Rename phase-named pgTAP test files** (refactor score 5/10)
  `supabase/tests/database/game_authoring_phase{2,3,5_1}_*.test.sql` are named
  after the authoring rollout phase that produced them, not the surface they
  test. Rename to `<feature>_<aspect>.test.sql` to match the convention set by
  `event_code_data_model.test.sql` and `redemption_data_model.test.sql`. Pure
  rename, behavior-preserving.
  Detail: [`docs/tracking/code-refactor-checklist.md`](/docs/tracking/code-refactor-checklist.md)

- [ ] **`dev` Stable PR screenshot upload path**
  Add `npm run ui:review:upload` backed by a scriptable durable provider so
  agents have a consistent, documented path for uploading UX review images.
  Detail: [`docs/tracking/dev-workflow-improvements.md` — Add a stable PR screenshot upload path](/docs/tracking/dev-workflow-improvements.md)

- [ ] **`infra` Investigate planning-doc location**
  The `/docs/plans/archive/` set keeps growing, plan-only and
  plan-archive-maintenance PRs inflate the repo PR count, and plan PRs need
  different review than code PRs. Codex review against in-repo code and
  Claude Code's single-repo model rule out moving the per-phase implementation
  contract to a sibling repo; the open question is whether discussion-style
  surfaces (epic framing, scoping back-and-forth, deferred decisions) can
  move to GitHub Discussions or similar without losing their protective check.
  Detail: [`docs/plans/planning-doc-location.md`](/docs/plans/planning-doc-location.md)

- [ ] **`ux` Event details inline vs. dedicated route**
  Decide whether event details should remain in the selected workspace or move
  to a dedicated route once the page gets denser.
  Detail: [`docs/tracking/admin-ux-roadmap.md` — Decide whether event details should stay inline](/docs/tracking/admin-ux-roadmap.md)

- [ ] **`dev` Broader Playwright coverage**
  Add retry-after-401, backend failure states, and post-merge nightly integration
  scenarios once the core suite is stable.
  Detail: [`docs/testing.md` — Soon After / Later Only If Needed](/docs/testing.md)

- [ ] **`decision` Trust boundary for live events**
  Determine whether browser-session dedupe is sufficient once the product is
  used at real events or whether person-level or device-level controls are
  needed.
  Detail: [`docs/open-questions.md` — Trust Boundary And Abuse Controls](/docs/open-questions.md)
